# Config Based Scraper Frontend

You can start the frontend by using:
1. `npm i` 
2. `npm run dev`

You can set variable `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in `.env` file if you want to set a custom host.


The response for the scraping is currently displayed as a string of json. That will be changed soon.

Thank you.
